---Installing packages---

Required packages:

pandas
numpy
czifile
matplotlib
skimage

To install each package you have to write the following command for each one of them on the terminal:

pip install write_your_package_name_here



---Running the Program---

To run the program you have to open the terminal in the folder where the code is (bbox_assignment) and type the following commmand replacing the capital letter names with the desired ones:

python create_manual_bboxes.py --image_path CZI_IMAGE_PATH --coordinates_file_name DESIRED_COORDINATES_NAME --color_order ORDER_OF_RGB_CHANNELS_IN_CZI_IMAGE

### 
Example:

python create_manual_bboxes.py --image_path P6_ICAM2.czi --coordinates_file_name P6_coordinates --color_order gbr

###

You can also load the bounding box coordinates you have already done and continue working on that. To do it just type the following command on the comand line:

python load_bboxes.py --image_path CZI_IMAGE_PATH --coordinates_file_path COORDINATES_NPY_FILE_PATH --color_order ORDER_OF_RGB_CHANNELS_IN_CZI_IMAGE

### 
Example:

python load_bboxes.py --image_path P6_ICAM2.czi --coordinates_file_path P6_coordinates.npy --color_order gbr

###




---Drawing bboxes---

#D - activates draw - just click in 2 points and it will save and plot the cuboid. Be careful not to click on anything but the points you desire while you are on drawing mode
#A - deactivates draw
#X - removes previous cuboid-but only the most recent one, it cannot elimate other than the current one even if you keep pressing
#The results are saved in the shape (y1,x1,y2,x2,z1,z2) in an excel and numpy array files
#You can use zoom in and zoom out (be careful not to do it while on drawing mode)
#The boxes may sometimes appear incomplete. Don't worry, if you zoom in you will be able to see all the lines.
#The results are saved when you close the drawing window
